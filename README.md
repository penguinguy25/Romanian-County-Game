## More Important Details
- This game also **doesn't include Romanian characters** such as 'ș' and 'ț' etc. despite being in most official county names, this is because I hate using different keyboard layouts. **You're probably not really missing much** from the normal county name **either way**, **just different pronunciations**.
- To select options from the main menu, type and enter **the number assigned to the option**. For example (options below might change with future updates):<br>
  ```1. Play the all-counties naming game```<br>
  ```2. View all the counties```<br>
  ```> 1``` --- **press enter**, doing so will **select the first option** (do this process with **all existing options**)<br><br>
- All input screens are **case-insensitive**
  You will **not need** to type the name of the county/US state **in lowercase** (for example "iasi", "arkansas" etc.) despite them being saved like this in the source code.
